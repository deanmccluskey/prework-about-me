        <h2>Pink Floyd's Bio
        </h2>
        <p>Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic 
            band, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical 
            lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are 
            one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in popular music history.
        </p>
        <p>Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar and lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger 
            Waters (bass and vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, 
            they released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn 
            (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 
            due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became their primary lyricist and thematic leader, 
            devising the concepts behind the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), 
            Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The band also composed several film scores.
        </p>
        <p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and 
            Mason continued as Pink Floyd, joined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary 
            Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and continued to tour before quietly disbanding in 
            1995. In 2005, all the members except Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness 
            event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless 
            River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material from The 
            Division Bell recording sessions. Pink Floyd are considered one of the first groups of British 
            psychedelia and are credited with inspiring the development of genres such as progressive rock and 
            ambient music. They had four albums that topped US or UK record charts; the songs "See Emily Play" 
            (1967) and "Another Brick in the Wall" (1982) were the group's only top 10 singles in either territory. 
            The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 
            2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side of the Moon 
            and The Wall two of the best-selling albums of all time. -- Wikipedia
